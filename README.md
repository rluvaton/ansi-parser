# ansi-parser

[Great blog post on ansi escape codes](https://tforgione.fr/posts/ansi-escape-codes/)


## TODOs
- [ ] Add a way to create a new file from input file that only have the initial styles in each line
      Maybe have each line a fixed length for easy seek so can pickup and read lines really fast
